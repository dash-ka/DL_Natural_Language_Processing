### PyTorch: Basics

There are many deep learing frameworks that you can use to design and deploy your neural network applications. **PyTorch** is a well documented and easy to learn deep learning framework, especially popular in the research community. [**PyTorch_Basics.ipynb**](./PyTorch_Basics.ipynb) notebook will help you familiarize with the library.  It collects the basic functions and methods that will turn useful in practical applications.
For further details and more advanced methods, check out the official documentation. (https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/ptcheat.html)

### PyTorch: Building NNs

[**Deep_Learning_with_PyTorch.ipynb**](./Deep_Learning_with_PyTorch.ipynb) notebook delves deeper into PyTorch functional. We explore the core PyTorch features and  learn the fundamentals underlying PyTorch deep learning applications, such as computational graphs and automatic differentiation. Finally, we build our first Neural Network and set up the routine for neural netowork training.

### Practice: Yelp Reviews Classification :)

Now it's time to leave the sandbox and have fun with some real world deep learning application. In [**Neural_Sentiment_Classification.ipynb**](./Neural_Sentiment_Classification.ipynb)  we'll design a neural model to classify the sentiment on Yelp Restaurant Reviews.
