### PyTorch: Basics

There are many deep learing frameworks that you can use to design and deploy your neural network applications. **PyTorch** is a well documented and easy to learn framework, especially popular in the research community. [**PyTorch_Basics.ipynb**](./PyTorch_Basics.ipynb) notebook will equip you will necessary technical knowledge to familarize with the library. It collects the basic functions you will hopefully find helpful in practical applications.
For more detailed explanation and advanced methods, check out official documentation. (https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/ptcheat.html)

### PyTorch: Building NNs

[**Deep_Learning_with_PyTorch.ipynb**](./Deep_Learning_with_PyTorch.ipynb) notebook delves deeper into PyTorch functional. We explore the core PyTorch features and  learn the fundamentals underlying PyTorch deep learning applications, such as computational graphs and automatic differentiation. Finally, we build our first Neural Network and set up the routine for neural netowork training.

### Practice: Yelp Reviews Classification :)

Now it's time to put in practice what we've learned with previous notebooks. In [**Sentiment Classification with NNs.ipynb**](./Sentiment Classification with NNs.ipynb)  we'll design a neural model to solve a real world case of sentiment classification of restaurant reviews.
