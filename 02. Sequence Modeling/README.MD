The goal of resources collected in this repository is to show the easy way to model linguistic data where the order matters: sequences.

Here you can find materials that will make you familiar with basic neural models excelling in sequence modeling task: Recurrent Neural Networks.
We provide you with intuition about recurrent neural networks, and illustrate their power with 2 practical applications:

First, we try out recurrent neural model in classification setting. (Yelp Restaurant Reviews classification with RNNs)

[**Shakespear_Alive!.ipynb**](./Shakespear_Alive!.ipynb) we will learn to generate Shakespearean-like text. task of Language Modeling, comparing classical N-Gram and Neural approaches on Shakespearean style writting.
