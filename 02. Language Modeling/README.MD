# Sequence Modeling



In this Lecture you will learn how to model linguistic data where the order matters: sequences.
Here you can find materials that will make you familiar with basic neural models excelling in sequence modeling task: Recurrent Neural Networks.
We provide you with intuition about recurrent neural networks, and illustrate their power with 2 practical applications:

First, we try out recurrent neural model in classification setting. (Yelp Restaurant Reviews classification with RNNs)

Then, we approach the fascinating task of Language Modeling, comparing classical N-Gram and Neural approaches on Shakespearean style writting.
